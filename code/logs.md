Finished coding forward integration and cost calculation. 
Todos are (1) write the simplest optimization routine, (2) come up with a code that searches for initial conditions, (3) implement saving of results, and possible recyling on new round of fitting

Integration working, figure out how to handle zero species in the observations. Almost there in the integration

Finish seting up Fit object by inheriting all classes. Then integrate, optimize, and we're gucci

Model is not changing the parameters of fit. think of a way to build model without fit, and build fit at the end with data, model and cost function
